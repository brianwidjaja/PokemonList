## PokemonList

This project was built using React and Javascript! 

I created this project as a way to showcase some of my favourite Pokemon and I thought it would be a fun way to learn and develop my React skills. 

Users are able to add Pokemon to their own individual list using the 'Add Pokemon' button. By inputting a Pokemon's Pokedex entry number, they can personalize their Pokemon's name, HP value, level, and the date that they were captured. Furthermore, users have fun tools they can use to cutomize and gain insight into their team: they can organize their team based off the year that they were captured, and the average level of Pokemon captured within the same year.
